# tRIBS Workshop Sandbox

Welcome to the **tRIBS (TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator)** interactive environment. This repository provides a cloud-native, zero-install "Sandbox" for running distributed hydrologic simulations with tRIBS. 

This environment is designed for **GitHub Codespaces** to provide a pre-configured Linux environment with all C++ dependencies, the tRIBS model engine, and the `pytRIBS` Python library ready for use.

---

## Quick Start: Launching the Sandbox

You do not need to install anything on your local machine. Follow these steps to launch the model in your browser:

### 1. Create a Github Account
A GitHub account is required to use Codespaces. 

### 2. Create your own Sandbox
Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page and select **"Create a new repository."** This gives you a private copy to save your work to your own GitHub account. When prompted, give the repository a name like "tRIBS-SMF-Codespace" for tRIBS South Mountain Fan Codespace.

### 3. Launch Codespaces
In your new repository, click the green **"<> Code"** button, select the **"Codespaces"** tab, and click **"Create codespace on main."**

### 4. Open the Notebook
Once the environment loads (this may take 4-5 minutes the first time), open the `workspaces/SMF/lab/` folder and click on `Make_SMF_Model.ipynb` to get started. Once the Jupyter Notebook is opened the Codespace will recognize that you want to use Jupyter and will download some additional files to the Codespace. The Codespace is an in-browser version of Microsoft's VScode that can be used to run the example notebook to setup and run the tRIBS model for the South Mountain Fan Watershed.

The notebooks are meant to be run in order:
1.  **`Make_SMF_Model.ipynb`:** build and configure the tRIBS model.
2.  **`Run_Model.ipynb`:** run the model and visualize the results.
3.  **`Run_FreqStorm_Model.ipynb`:** run the calibrated model against a synthetic 100-year design storm and compare it to the calibration event.

`Generate_Met_Forcing.ipynb` is optional — only run it if you want to change the simulation's time window; the default forcing data is already provided.

## What’s Inside?

This sandbox is pre-loaded with:
*   **The tRIBS Model Engine:** A fully compiled C++ executable of the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator.
*   **pytRIBS:** Our Python API for pre-processing terrain data, managing simulations, and visualizing results.
*   **Sample Data:** A 5 $km^2$ high-resolution watershed dataset (DEM, Soil, and Land Use) ready for simulation.
*   **Computational Environment:** A Debian-based Linux environment with Python 3.11, CMake, and all necessary spatial libraries.

---

## Educational Objectives

In this sandbox, you will  explore **physically-based distributed hydrology** using tRIBS:
1.  **TIN Generation:** Learn how Voronoi polygons represent watershed complex topography more efficiently than grids.
2.  **Parameterization:** Adjust soil hydraulic properties and vegetation parameters (Interception, ET).
3.  **Simulation:** Run the model and observe states evolve across the landscape.
4.  **Analysis:** Visualize surface-subsurface interactions and simulated hydrograph responses to the August 2014 flow event at South Mountain Fan.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

*   **"Don't know how to open this / open as a text file?":** Click **no**. This means the
    notebook editor has not finished loading in your browser yet, usually on a slow or
    congested network. The notebook itself is fine. Wait for the Extensions panel to stop
    working, then press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac), run
    **"Developer: Reload Window"**, and open the notebook again. If you answer *yes* you
    get the notebook's raw JSON, which looks broken but is not.
*   **Slow or unusable network:** Read-only HTML copies of the notebooks, figures included,
    are in [`docs/notebooks/`](docs/notebooks/). They need only a browser, so you can follow
    the lab even if the Codespace will not load.
*   **Kernel Not Found:** If prompted for a kernel, select **"Python 3.11.x"** (the Recommended version).
*   **Model Build Issues:** If `!tRIBS` does not return a help message in the notebook, try rebuilding the container:
    1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
    2. Type **"Codespaces: Rebuild Container"** and press Enter.
*   **Storage:** Large simulation results are ignored by Git to keep the repo fast. Be sure to save your plots (PNGs) if you need them for your report!

## Maintainer notes

*   **Refreshing the offline HTML:** run both lab notebooks end to end in a codespace, save
    them, then `bash tools/export_notebooks.sh` and commit `docs/notebooks/*.html`. See
    [`docs/notebooks/README.md`](docs/notebooks/README.md) for why the notebooks must be run
    first.
